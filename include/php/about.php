		<p>
			There are a number of reasons why an online enrollment website should be implemented in a school. This study
			aims to establish a better system for the people who will utilize it as they are ones who will greatly
			benefit from the result.

						Learners.
					</h2>

					<p>
						The product of this developmental process will enable the learners to enroll online directly
						through the school’s website. Learners play one of the vital roles in an institution and ever
						since the schools closed, the need for internet connectivity is bigger than ever and so is the
						finding for a more efficient way of online admission in schools. With the development of this
						online enrollment, the learners can go online and have the option to submit enrollment
						information instantly.

					<h2>
						Administration.
					</h2>

					<p>
						School administration keeps in direct contact with the community, provides it with care and
						education, and a proper environment that would academically qualify students well, leading
						eventually to the progress of the community and upgrade its level. Among the core
						functionalities of the Administration when it comes to LMS is to enroll new users to the
						platform, so with this online enrollment website development, they can monitor the enrollees
						much better and easier because the website will have its own functionalities.

						MIC (Management Information Center).
					</h2>

					<p>
						The MIC of the university are the ones who manage the enrollees, therefore, they’re among those
						who will greatly benefit from this development. With the implementation of an online enrollment,
						they can manage the enrollees much easier through the actual website itself because it’s
						specifically built for enrollment so the data will be more organized. Their efficiency will also
						increase because of less workload and hassle.

					<h2>
						Faculty.
					</h2>

					<p>
						The teaching role of faculty members reflects their centrality in addressing the primary
						educational mission among colleges and universities. With the increasing dependency on
						technology, this study will help the faculty familiarize themselves with the features and
						mechanics of the online enrollment system provided which they can integrate in their own fair
						share of studies with the learners.

						Future Researchers.
					</h2>

					<p>
						This study can be used for re-assessing and expanding theory, framework or model that have been
						illustrated in this research. Further future studies can address the effects of specific events,
						emergence of a new theory or evidence and/or other recent phenomenon on this research problem
						such as the limitations of the study where it aims to be used as a developmental guide for
						similar future research.

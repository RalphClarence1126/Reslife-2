			Development of Web-Based Registration Platform for Online Enrollment
		</h1>

		<p>
			In today's pandemic environment, the Internet has become an essential tool for online platforms to
			emerge, and many people utilize the internet in their everyday lives, particularly at work and school. The
			Internet is a valuable resource for Îstudents, who depend on it on a regular basis to complete their tasks.
			Web-based platforms are run because of the internet. Web-based platforms make it easier for people to
			utilize them, and it is much easier to maintain effective communication between the sender and the
			recipient.
		</p>

		<p>
			Developing a great web-based registration platform for enrollment is a challenging process. Since the
			project is all about developing a website that benefits and assists students in processing their enrollment
			online with assurance, by performing online school registration through online registration. This kind of
			platform will be a huge help, as it is in today&#39;s situation, so it will be in the future, especially for
			students in terms of taking a school admission form without going to the university.
